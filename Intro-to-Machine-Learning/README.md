# Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow

**A Glimpse into the world of Machine Learning: Google Tech Labs Initiative**

Welcome to a concise overview of the talk, "An Introduction to Machine Learning," presented under the Google Tech Labs initiative on 3rd August 2023.

**1. Unraveling Machine Learning**
Machine learning stands as a pivotal branch of artificial intelligence (AI). It's the art and science where algorithms and computers evolve through data. Rather than being hard-coded, these systems harness data to make informed predictions or decisions. Dive deeper:
